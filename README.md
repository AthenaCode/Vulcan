## Notes for Question Three

While the carets look unappealing, they are still completely functional. If you click on them they will show the items in either ascending or descending order. 

## Notes for Question Two

I had some trouble finishing this question, due to time and problems with CORS and same origin poilicies that are in place most likely to prevent cross-site scripting or other security threats. While I did not finish I did create a search bar, and did set up the code required to fetch the document title from a website. If I had more time I would have set up a way to integrate CORS protocols into my application, probably having to look more into Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
However the code is still in this repo, and you can find it under src/QuestionTwo.
